<article>: As far as the DOT website says for my state in IOWA there is only a "work" permit if you have lost your license for some reason, and you are allowed to get a restricted one for driving to work, appointments, child care, school ect. But no where do I see a <18 work permit for driving. There is the work permit that allows you to work period before your sixteen but that is all I see. Anyone know? That being said for this idea the person did not get their "permit" until they are 17, so my state if not nationally requires one year of driving with it to drive alone.
<summary>: Is there a driving work permit for being younger than 18, or are you screwed with not getting a permit before your 17 and will have to wait until turning 18?


<article>: To put it simply, we have been going out for almost three years, and she still can't even say she loves me if anyone can hear. I have talked to her about it, and she said she is working on it. she said this two years ago... This does affect our relationship, I feel like our relationship is some dirty secret, and I don't want that. I don't expect her to full on snog me when her dad can see, but at least hold my hand... Firstly, is this too much to ask, and secondly, if not: How can I get her to just me a little less shy?
<summary>: My girlfriend is so shy, she can't even hold my hand if anyone can see. How can I get her to be just a little less shy? (It doesn't help to talk to her)


<article>: I just transferred to this new school 2 weeks ago after being taken out of an abusive situation with my mom. I still have a boyfriend where I lived. I had been having small conversations with this guy he offered me some cupcakes and i was like hell yea i love cupcakes then he said something along the lines of "the condition is you have to go to prom with me" i said "sure out of impulse but then processed the situation and was like wait noooo. But I didn't want to say it cause how awful is it to accept a prom proposal and be whoops i actually meant to say no. What do i do? I want to remain loyal to my boyfriend and have no interest in going to prom with anybody but him.
<summary>: I accepted a prom proposal before fully listening to the question because I was focussing on eating my cupcake, i have a long distance boyfriend.
